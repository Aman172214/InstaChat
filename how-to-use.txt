This project actually contains two projects:
- A React.js application (i.e., the frontend SPA), which is the UI for the chat app.
- A backend API to which the React app can "talk" (to send + fetch data), which uses websocket for real time conversation.

You must run "npm install" in both project folders.

Thereafter, you can start the backend API server via "npm start" (inside the "backend-api" folder).
The React app dev server is then started via "npm run dev" (though inside the "react-frontend" folder).

You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the projects to work.

Also create a uploads file in the backend folder to store the files sent via messages.
